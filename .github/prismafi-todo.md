Repository: `prismafi-dex`

## 0. Agent execution protocol

These rules are mandatory for the coding agent working in this repository.

### 0.1 Source of truth
- This file is the single source of truth for task execution order.
- The agent must always work from this file.
- The agent must not invent unrelated tasks unless they are strictly required to complete an existing item.
- If a new required task is discovered, the agent must add it to the appropriate section before implementing it.

### 0.2 Task completion behavior
After finishing each task or meaningful subtask, the agent must:

1. Mark the task as completed in this file by changing `- [ ]` to `- [x]`.
2. Add a short execution note under the task if useful, including files touched and important implementation decisions.
3. Run the relevant checks before considering the task done:
   - lint
   - type-check
   - test, if applicable
   - build, if the task affects production code
4. Create a git commit with a clear, professional commit message.
5. Push the branch to the remote repository immediately after the commit.

### 0.3 Git rules
- The agent must commit after every completed task or coherent subtask.
- The agent must push after every commit.
- Commit messages must be professional and descriptive.
- Preferred commit format:
  - `feat: add swap widget shell`
  - `feat: integrate wallet connection`
  - `refactor: extract market table hooks`
  - `fix: handle unsupported network state`
  - `docs: update architecture and setup notes`
- The agent must never accumulate many unrelated changes into one commit.
- The agent must never mark a task as done if the code is not committed and pushed.

### 0.4 If push is not possible
If the environment does not allow pushing to GitHub:
- The agent must still complete the code task.
- The agent must still mark the task done only after preparing the exact git commands.
- The agent must output the exact commands required:
  - `git add .`
  - `git commit -m "<message>"`
  - `git push origin <branch>`
- The agent must clearly state that the push is pending manual execution.

### 0.5 Quality gate
The agent must not mark any item complete if:
- lint fails;
- type-check fails;
- the build is broken;
- major console/runtime errors remain;
- the implementation does not match the architecture rules in `copilot-instructions.md`.

### 0.6 Architecture discipline
- UI components must stay separate from Web3/business logic.
- Blockchain interactions must live in dedicated hooks/adapters.
- No raw mock values should leak into production integration files.
- No `any`.
- No copy-paste duplication across features.
- No giant unstructured components.

## 1. Product definition

### 1.1 Vision
Build **PrismaFi** — a tokenized Forex DEX on Polkadot EVM where users can trade synthetic fiat assets such as `tEUR`, `tJPY`, and `tGBP` against stablecoins through a professional institutional-grade interface.

### 1.2 Core MVP
The MVP is complete when:
- [ ] user can connect wallet
- [ ] user can view supported FX pairs
- [ ] user can enter an amount and get a quote
- [ ] user can execute a basic swap flow
- [ ] user can see balances before and after swap
- [ ] user can see transaction state and feedback
- [ ] app is consistently styled in the PrismaFi Rose Liquid Glass design system
- [ ] repository is documented and demo-ready

### 1.3 Product principles
- [ ] prioritize a polished demo over protocol overreach
- [ ] keep architecture production-minded even for MVP
- [ ] keep UX simple, calm, and institutional
- [ ] separate UI, domain logic, and Web3 integration
- [ ] prefer real wallet flow with mock market data over fake full-stack complexity
- [ ] keep backend optional and minimal

### 1.4 Out of scope for MVP
- [ ] full order book matching engine
- [ ] production oracle network implementation
- [ ] real-world legal fiat redemption rails
- [ ] advanced cross-chain bridge
- [ ] mobile app
- [ ] admin backoffice
- [ ] high-frequency trading system

## 21. Session log template

Use this section to keep short notes while executing.

### Example entry
- Date:
- Task completed:
- Files changed:
- Checks run:
- Commit:
- Push:
- Notes:

---

## 22. Commit log expectation

For every completed task, add one short note in the relevant section if the change was substantial. Example:

- [x] create swap card
  - Note: implemented `SwapCard.tsx`, extracted `AmountInput.tsx`, added disabled CTA states.
  - Commit: `feat: add swap card UI`
  - Push: completed

This pattern is required throughout execution.
